## 🌆 **About**

> Bin-It-Bit is a 2D game created in hopes of spreading environmental awareness and tackling one of the causes of environmental and climate changes. We believe the first step to tackling climate change is changing the way we live our daily lives. It starts with you, and we are hear to guide you to start a new habit: recycling.

> Users can learn what materials are recyclable in New York. The game's goal is for users to be more conscious about the garbage they are throwing away.
